# üìÅ About the project

Python project developed for Distributed Systems college discipline -  The projet is built using Flask to search on the Transfermarkt website (https://www.transfermarkt.com/) the player name and club and return infos about his age, position and market value. If the player isn't found on the search it will return a not found message.
This is a simple flask app, but the objective of the project was to deploy it in a cloud computing service, for this project, we decided to use Microsoft Azure and the deployment on web was made possible using this tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_RTlbOOCts&ab_channel=KasamShaikh
